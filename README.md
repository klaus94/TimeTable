these things are working:

* read in multiple courses and generate all possible timetables
** available read-in-methods:
*** from file
*** from internet
* filter the created list: 
** available filters:
*** earliest course
*** latest course
*** minimum courses per day
*** maximum courses per day
*** maximum courses in a row

* TODO:
** filter: look for timetables where two courses of the same modulename take place at the same time
** filter: fix a course
