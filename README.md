# TimeTable

these things are working:

- read in multiple courses and generate all possible timetables
- filter the created list: 
	available filters:
		> earliest course
		> latest course
		> minimum courses per day
		> maximum courses per day
		> maximum courses in a row

TODO:
- filter: look for timetables where two courses of the same modulename take place at the same time
- filter: fix a course
- read-in all courses from xml-file
- GUI
